# Encoder-Decoder Game (Atbash Cipher)

A simple Java program that encodes and decodes strings using the Atbash Cipher algorithm with recursion.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code:
   javac Main.java
2. Run the program:
   java Main
3. Choose:
    - Option 1 to encode a string
    - Option 2 to decode a string

## How it Works
- Atbash Cipher replaces each letter with its counterpart from the end of the alphabet (A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, etc.).
- The same function can be used for both encoding and decoding.
- Recursion is used to process the string character by character.
